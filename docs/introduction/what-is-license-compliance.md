A license is a set of rules that define how others may use, distribute, modify and interact with the your project and License compliance refers to the procedure of ensuring that software is being used in accordance with its licensing terms and conditions,Proper license compliance can help ensure that software is used legally and ethically while also protecting the intellectual property rights of software creators and reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities caused by unapproved or improperly licensed software.
Failure to comply with licensing terms can result in legal and financial consequences,including loss of access to the software.

Open source is source code that can be modified and redistribed without any cost and An open source license allows redistribution of the source code under legal terms and conditions,
The most common open source software license is the GNU General Public License (GPL) which was created by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).GPL requires that any software that is distributed under its terms must be released under the same license,and modifications should be done in public mode.
there are two types of free open license compliance:-
<br>
1)permissive(least restriction)
2)copyleft(most restricted)
<br>
1)A permissive software license,(BSD-like or BSD-style license),is a free-software license which carries minimal restrictions on how the software can be used, modified, and redistributed, usually including a warranty disclaimer.
Examples include:-
1)GNU All-permissive License
2)MIT License As of 2016, the most popular free-software license,
3)BSD licenses
4)Apple Public Source License
5)Apache license
<br>
2)Copyleft software licenses(reciprocal licenses)are considered more protective than permissive licenses,instead of providing the source code completely to the public,copyleft allows authors to impose restrictions on the use of their work.requiring that information necessary for reproducing and modifying the work must be made available to users(which are often distributed as binary executables).
Examples include:-
1)the GNU General Public License (GPL),which was the first software copyleft license to see extensive use is a series of widely used free software licenses that guarantee users the freedom to run,share,and modify the software.
2)the Mozilla Public License(MPL) is a free and open-source weak copyleft license for most Mozilla Foundation software such as Firefox and Thunderbird.
3)the Creative Commons (CC) license is one of several public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted "work".A CC license is used when an author wants to give other people the right to share, use, and build upon a work that the author has created.
